This was an assignment from my Artificial Intelligence course.
The purpose of the assignment was to illustrate the curse of dimensionality. My main task was to use matplotlib to graph the relationship
between dimensionality and dmax/dmin ratio. Overall, this assignment helped me get more comfortable with matplotlib and sklearn.
